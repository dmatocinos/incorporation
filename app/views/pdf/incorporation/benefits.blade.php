<h1>
The Benefits of Becoming Incorporated
</h1>


<h3>
Liability Protection
</h3>

<p>
Limitation of liability is another major advantage of incorporation.  The Company; being a separate entity leading its own business life, the members are not liable for its debts. The liability of members is limited by shares; each member is bound to pay the nominal value of shares held by them and his/her liability ends there.
</p>


<h3>
Credibility
</h3>

<p>
Incorporating a business also lends credibility to a company.  Companies that incorporate are deemed professional entities by the public and business community.  This imparts professionalism and denotes the company is legally established and registered and there is a greater chance to obtain finance.

<h3>
Taxation
</h3>

<p>
Our Incorporation PlannerPro software can easily demonstrate the rates of corporation tax for profits left in a company are very low.
</p>

<h3>
Corporate Losses
</h3>

<p>
Any losses incurred by the corporation may be written off, and there are no limits or restrictions on the amount of capital or the operating losses that a corporation may carry back or forward to subsequent tax years.  Businesses that are not incorporated do not have the same flexibility to carry losses into the future or designate them in previous years.
</p>

<h3>
Transfer Ownership
</h3>

<p>
A key consideration is that it is easier to sell shares in a company that it is to sell shares in a partnership. Investors and buyers tend to prefer incorporated companies, as their accounts will be of a higher standard and well maintained.
</p>

<h3>
Improved Profits
</h3>

<p>
By incorporating you can pay yourself a salary and then any profits on top of that will be taxed at corporation rates. If you remain as a sole trader you will be paying National Insurance and income tax at the normal rates – which in turn reduces your net profit.
</p>

<h3>
Employment
</h3>

<p>
In many circumstances, the business owner will find the overall incorporation package much more tax efficient instead of being taxed on profits.
</p>

<h3>
Pensions
</h3>

<p>
With a company, pension provision can be more beneficial and flexible. There are many advantages and a director’s pension contributions receive tax relief through many forms of pension vehicles. Personal pensions, company schemes and self-administered schemes are just a few examples.
</p>

<h3>
Costs and Procedures of a Company
</h3>

<p>
Where companies are qualified as small, where turnover is below £6.5m, and gross assets are less that £3.26m; limited companies are not required to have their accounts audited. Essentially small companies will avoid this often costly and burdening procedure.
