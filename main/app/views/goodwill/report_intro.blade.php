		What is Goodwill?
		<p>
			Goodwill is best described as what a company’s name or reputation is worth if it was sold. You’ve worked hard to gain a good reputation and this is why Goodwill has a value. So if customers were being attracted to a business because of the name then it is generating customers because of the reputation – this is not something that you can see or touch so it’s ‘intangible’. 
		When you transfer a business into a company there is one off opportunity to save a significant amount of tax.
		</p>

		Why do we want to value Goodwill?
		<p>
			When we look at sole trade or partnerships being incorporated to a limited company we would value the assets currently held; vehicles, stock, fixture, machinery etc. But there is a one off opportunity to also effectively sell the value of Goodwill to a new limited company (even if it’s owned by the same person). The Goodwill value that can be agreed is allowable as an expense for Corporation Tax, so clients can see a reduction in their tax bill because they have sold their own name to their own company! A saving between 20-23%, depending on profit levels, on the total Goodwill value is possible. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Not only can the company save tax but as the individual is selling their business to a limited company then that same company would owe the individual the value in ‘cash’. This would be credited to the directors loan account so at a point in time when the company has accumulated the funds to pay this; the individual would be able to draw on the money without paying Income Tax or National Insurance, saving an effective dividend rate of 25% or 36.1% depending on if they are a higher rate tax payer or not.
