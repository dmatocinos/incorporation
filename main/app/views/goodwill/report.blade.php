	<div> <p>Based upon our initial estimate of the value of your Goodwill, the tax savings for you will be estimated at £{{ $data['summary']['bpk_fee_for_capitalisation'] }}</p></div>


	<br/>
	<div>2. Summary of Accountants Fee:</div>
	<p>Our fee for saving you £{{ $data['summary']['overall_savings'] }} will be £{{ $data['summary']['bpk_fee_for_capitalisation'] }}.  If we are able to find even bigger tax savings as a result of our negotiations with HMRC, we will invoice you {{ ($business->fee_based_on_tax_saved / 100) }}% of the tax saved.  If we are not able to obtain this level of tax savings we will reduce our fee again to {{ ($business->fee_based_on_tax_saved / 100) }}%  of the tax saved.</p> 

<p>In order for work to commence a small initial payment on account of £500 + VAT will be payable; this payment on account will be deducted from the final fee due.</p>
